IN THIS ARTICLE Text Messages for Consumer  Financial Services  Solutions by Text provides a PCI DSS- compliant platform to send messages and  collect payments from consumers called  Fintext. Among the 1,500 businesses using  Fintext are financial institutions, credit card  issuers, marketplaces and collection agencies. Fintext leverages the main advantage of text  messages—more than 90% are read in three  minutes. Text messages are not emotional,  and they provide consumers with a degree of  confidentiality versus a conversation with a  call center service representative.  Solutions by Text integrates via API with a  customer’s CRM and consumer finance user  platforms as well as loan origination and  servicing software. Customers can message  consumers about loans from origination  through servicing and payment. Customers provide Solutions by Text with  the billing information needed to reach their  customers. All payment steps are branded  with the customer’s logo.  Consumers receive a text showing the  account number, invoice number, amount due  and the due date. Payments are made without  directing the consumer to a website login  page or application. Payment reminders are delivered with self- serve options. Payments can be authorized  with text keyword responses.  Solutions by Text is available on a subscription  basis that covers outbound and inbound  transactions, including notifications and  alerts. Growth equity firm Edison Partners  purchased a majority of the equity in  Solutions by Text in 2021.

This  allows for multifactor ID verification before  a payment is processed. EVS informs the  merchant if card and identification details  match successfully. AssurePay can make a match with a minimum  of the BIN, the last four numbers of a card  and a cardholder’s zip code. Any additional  information from the cardholder allows EVS to  be more accurate in its verification. If the payment is flagged, the merchant can  block the transaction, rather than relying  on their payment processor to catch a  problematic payment after the transaction  has been requested. After seven months of operation, EVS says  that AssurePay has contributed to a seven  basis point improvement in chargebacks for  companies that have adopted the service.   EVS does not offer a cash guarantee for  AssurePay transactions because EVS cannot  block the transaction. While EVS does offer services to Canadian  customers, AssurePay is only available in the  US. Users of the service are billed monthly on  a subscription basis.
